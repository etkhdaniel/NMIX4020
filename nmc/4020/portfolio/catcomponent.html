<h2>Cat Components Vue.js Project</h2>
<p>For the sixth project of the Advanced Web Development course (NMIX 4020) I created a website that displays slideshows of images of different breeds of cats and their corresponding attributes. Although this is a pretty basic website looks wise, it really challenged me to make use of Vue.js to create and re-use a component for the slideshows and get creative with CSS to style to page to keep each breed in their own section.</p>
