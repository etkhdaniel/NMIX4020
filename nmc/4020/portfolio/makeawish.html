<h2>Messaging That Matters</h2>
<p>For Morgan Stanley's Code-to-Give hack-a-thon, my team partnered with the Make-a-Wish Foundation to draft a responsive messaging app that would allow users to track the status of their wish, connect with local Wish families and alumni's, and message and send documents to their Wish coordinator. This app was drafted using Figma, and an interactive demo was made using React Native and Express.js.</p>
