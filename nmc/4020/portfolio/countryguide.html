<h2>Country Guide Search Engine & Currency Converter</h2>
<p>For the final project of the Advanced Web Development course (NMIX 4020) I created a website that displays information about a given country such as flag and currency. In this project I got to apply everything I learned this whole semester to create a website using APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this project didn't turn out how envisioned, I am still proud how it turned out and think it was a very solid way to tie all of the elements we learned this semester.</p>
